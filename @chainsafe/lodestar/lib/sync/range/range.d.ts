/**
 * RangeSync groups peers by their `status` into static target `SyncChain` instances
 * Peers on each chain will be queried for batches until reaching their target.
 *
 * Not all SyncChain-s will sync at once, and are grouped by sync type:
 * - Finalized Chain Sync
 * - Head Chain Sync
 *
 * ### Finalized Chain Sync
 *
 * At least one peer's status finalized checkpoint is greater than ours. Then we'll form
 * a chain starting from our finalized epoch and sync up to their finalized checkpoint.
 * - Only one finalized chain can sync at a time
 * - The finalized chain with the largest peer pool takes priority
 * - As peers' status progresses we will switch to a SyncChain with a better target
 *
 * ### Head Chain Sync
 *
 * If no Finalized Chain Sync is active, and the peer's STATUS head is beyond
 * `SLOT_IMPORT_TOLERANCE`, then we'll form a chain starting from our finalized epoch and sync
 * up to their head.
 * - More than one head chain can sync in parallel
 * - If there are many head chains the ones with more peers take priority
