/**
 * Wraps a _processRpcMessage() function with a queue, to limit the processing of gossip objects by type.
 *
 * A queue here is essential to protect against DOS attacks, where a peer may send many messages at once.
 * Queues also protect the node against overloading. If the node gets busy with an expensive epoch transition,
 * it may buffer too many gossip objects causing an Out of memory (OOM) error. With a queue the node will reject
 * new objects to fit its current throughput.
 *
 * Queues may buffer objects by
 *  - topic '/eth2/0011aabb/beacon_attestation_0/ssz_snappy'
 *  - type `GossipType.beacon_attestation`
 *  - all objects in one queue
 *
 * By topic is too specific, so by type groups all similar objects in the same queue. All in the same won't allow
 * to customize different queue behaviours per object type (see `gossipQueueOpts`).
